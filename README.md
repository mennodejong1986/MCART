# MCART
Markov Chain Analysis based Reconstruction of TMCRA

MCART is a tool for rapid and intuitive estimation of the TMCRA (time to most recent common ancestor) of two sister species. It takes as input a bam-file generated by the user by mapping sequencing reads of species A to the reference genome of species B.
